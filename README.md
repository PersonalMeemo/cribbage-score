Ruby program to calculate a cribbage score to solve the Intermediate Daily Programmer Challenge #335
(https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/75p1cs/20171011_challenge_335_intermediate_scoring_a/)

This is my first Ruby program, and accepts input in form of a text file containing a string of 5 cards, for example, 5D,QS,JC,KH,AC (score for this should be 10). I learnt a few new methods in the process, and am pleased that it works, but would aim for a more object oriented style in future.

Update: I have now refactored the code to make it more modular.
